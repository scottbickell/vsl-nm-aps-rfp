Dear %%first_name%%,

Join us for lunch and an engaging exploration of our LETRS® (Language Essentials for Teachers of Reading and Spelling) literacy PD solution with special guests, education specialist Toni Backstrom and Bloomfield Public Schools’ literacy coach Kelley Marquez. We are also excited to announce LETRS is approved as district-wide literacy PD for Albuquerque Public Schools.

LETRS is in alignment with HB230 legislation as the New Mexico Department of Education requires local school districts to ensure every teacher and administrator who teaches reading is trained to provide and implement appropriate research-based reading intervention.
